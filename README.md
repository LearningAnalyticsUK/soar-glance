## Student Outcome Accelerator (SOAR) - Glance

Welcome to the source code repository for Glance, a web application designed to
measure the accuracy of instructors' models of student performance in higher
education institutions. 

The tool was created as part of a [HEFCE](http://www.hefce.ac.uk/) funded
project at [Newcastle University](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/), focusing on "Human in
the Loop" Learning analytics.  It remains under active development.

### How it works

Lecturers (sometimes also refered to as instructors throughout this
documentation) are given a long url pointing to a specific Glance "Survey"



### Use cases
